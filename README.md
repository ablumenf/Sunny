## ABOUT:

Fun JavaScript app to tell you which episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia to watch based on what time of the week it is. If you choose a time without a unique correct answer (e.g., Tuesday at 11 AM), a suitable episode is randomly chosen from those closest to the current time. For the few episodes that don't say when they start (e.g., part 2 of various multi-part episodes and "The Gang Goes to Hell"), an educated guess is made based on the context that is provided within the episodes.
