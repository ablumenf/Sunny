## ABOUT:

Fun JavaScript app to tell you which episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia to watch based on what time of the week it is. If you choose a time without a unique correct
answer (e.g., Tuesday at 11 AM), a suitable episode is randomly chosen from those closest to the current time. For the few episodes that don't say when they start (e.g.,
part 2 of various multi-part episodes and "The Gang Goes to Hell"), an educated guess is made based on the context that is provided within the episodes.

Also includes a search engine so you can search for an episode and look up the season and episode number. It doesn't need to be exact text. For example, "mac dennis timeshare"
will retrieve "Season 9, Ep. 4: Mac and Dennis Buy a Timeshare." You can also set it to return just one episode or multiple (up to 10) episodes. Episodes completely irrelevant
to the search terms will not be retrieved. For example, the only result "social" will return is "The ANTI-Social Network."
